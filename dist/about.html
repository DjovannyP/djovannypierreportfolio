            <p>After my high school years, my dream of joining NASA’s active astronaut team gradually drifted away as I pursued a law
            degree at the State University of Haiti (UEH). While the title of Lawyer may have seemed appealing, my fascination with
            the workings of the internet and the validation of my thesis on its legal regulation became the starting point for my
            professional shift into the digital domain. However, it was my selection for the D-clic program (Digital Training) by
            the International Organization of La Francophonie (OIF), deployed in over 50 countries, that triggered this change.
            
            Since obtaining my certification in web development with HTML5 and CSS3 from the French online school OpenClassrooms
            through this program, I have embarked on the path of self-taught learning. Currently halfway through becoming a
            full-stack JavaScript developer via The Odin Project curriculum (TOP) and freeCodeCamp courses, my greatest strength
            remains my determination to achieve the goals I’ve set for myself and my insatiable desire to learn.

            <p>
            As the Website Manager at the Office of Citizen Protection (OPC) in Haiti, I played a pivotal role in not only managing
            but also initiating the creation of the organization's website. Taking on the responsibility of website development from
            inception, I successfully led the entire process. This encompassed overseeing the technical aspects, from design to
            day-to-day maintenance. My responsibilities included content management, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and
            the implementation of security and SEO optimization strategies. My commitment to the operational efficiency of the
            website significantly contributed to enhancing OPC's online presence, aligning with its mission to safeguard citizen
            rights and interests in Haiti.</p>
